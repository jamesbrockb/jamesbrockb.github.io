Since my last post it's been a roller coaster of emotions from having just started with basic coding through to web scraping and data visualization. While I knew learning the ropes of becoming a data scientist was going to be challenging, I didn't think it would have been this challenging. The work however, has been extremely rewarding. As complex as the work is, when you break it down line by line or look at it from a higher level, it really isn't all that bad. An area that I'm still working on wrapping my head around though, is the different kinds of visualization techniques and knowing when to use them. Throughout my first project with the Flatiron school, I took the time to understand how to use which ones where appropriate to help visualize the data I was trying to represent.

Just when I thought visualization techniques would be an easier section, it wasn’t. I already knew there were multiple ways to show your data (e.g. scatter plots, bar graphs, histograms etc.). What I didn’t realize is that there are different visualization tools like seaborn and matplotlib (plotly). Each one offers their own benefits while, in my opinion, plotly has some downfalls.

After doing A / B testing, with plotly and seaborn for my first project, I found that seaborn aligned more strongly with the majority of my workflow, as well as visual appeal. It wasn’t easy trying to figure this out. Again, I’m brand new to coding, so mixing up the syntax for plotly versus seaborn is a commonality for me.

One of the questions I created for my project was, which genre is the most profitable given the list of movies in a dataframe I created. Now the answer may seem straightforward to some, but for me, I was stuck on how I wanted to visualize it. I know I could go with your standard barplot to help show the total profits of each genre, but I was also thinking about histograms. I got lost in my train of thought and experimenting with different ways to set up this histogram, but nothing was working. This was certainly a valuable lesson for me to understand what I’m trying to show and how I’m trying to show it. After taking a step back and reiterating “Which genre is the most profitable?” I understood that a histogram wasn’t going to provide me with enough insight into the solution for this question. For me, and maybe others, I tend to dive straight into the work before understanding what I am trying to solve for.
